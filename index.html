              <p> Software developer </p>
              <ul>
                <li>My name is Muhajir</li>
                <li>I am based out of D.C.</li>
                <li>I currently work on various web projects.</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p> I work with </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Python</li>
          </ol>

          <p> I have experience working with small businesses and working with teams to fulfill the web and app needs of e-commerce brands. I've also worked with social media marketing teams, creating ad campaigns and photo/video content.</p>
          <p>I enjoy web development and marketing, and always look forward to working with brands and their teams to help come up with creative software solutions.</p>
          <p>What started as a hobby has turned into a passion for programming that is both interesting and creative. I recently finished a coding bootcamp to expand my skillset, and am always looking for new ways to learn and grow.</p>
          <p>Outside of building software I enjoy Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, photography, chess, and copious amounts of ice cream. I love how all of these incororate into my work as a developer. Jiu-Jitsu teaches you how to work really well with others, chess really helps creative problem solving, and photography works wonders for aesthetics and design sense.
          <br>As for the ice cream...well everybody loves ice cream, so it's great for team building.<p>
